Tips 1: In order to upgrade to the 3.5 kernel on 12.04.2, you will need to run the following command(s):

quantal(3.5)/trusty(3.13)
For the new kernel:
	sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-quantal
	sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-trusty

For the new X stack:
	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-lts-quantal
	
	
See Which Groups Your Linux User Belongs To
	groups
OR
	groups username
	
	
	
UNIX Add Existing User To A Primary Group	
	 usermod -g groupname username	

(Ubuntu 12.04) If you restsart ubuntu and the system is stuck at Checking battery state message:
then u probably have problem with lightdm or graphics drivers

	sudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
		select gdm
	And then reboot.


Restarting openvswitch
 service openvswitch-switch restart




			SSH-ing to vms created in virtual box:

1) create an host only interface in VirtualBox Manager:
	File> Preferences> network> Host Only Network> Add a new interface (say vboxnet0).
2) Make sure your VM is shut down. Select your VM and do followings:
	Right Click/Setting> Network> Adapter2/3> Enable Network Adapter > Attach to: Host-Only Adapter > Name : select the Host only adapter we just created.
3) Turn on the vm and do ifconfig -a to see all the interfaces. and get an Ip for the interface and bring it up: 
	sudo dhclient eth1 
	sudo ifconfig eth1 up
You will be able to see the Ip of that interface in "ifconfig" now

From your host you can ssh to this IP



			Sometimes the VM tyou downloaded might not have the ssh program installed init.
			Solving ssh issues in a virtualbox vm, ubuntu 12.04 server 32 bit

check if u have ssh installed
	sudo service ssh status

if the service isnt installed u need to install the following
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	
If openssh-server installationfails for libwrap0:
	wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/t/tcp-wrappers/libwrap0_7.6.q-21_i386.deb
	//or get another link by searching for libwrap0
	
Installing debian package:
	sudo dpkg -i package_name.deb
	
	
	
To change the sudo session timeout in linux to infinite:
	sudo visudo
Scroll down and write the following line at the end:
	Defaults:user_name timestamp_timeout=10
* Change user_name to your actual user name.  Change 10 (in minutes) to anything you wish. A value of -1 will make it infinite (for a single session).






To check whether IP Forwarding is enabled or not, you can use this command:
	sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

Enabling IP Forwarding Temporarily 
	sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
	

Enabling IP Forwarding Permanently
	sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf
	
Search and uncomment this line:       net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1



TCPdump
To see mac address with tcpdump:
 tcpdump -e -i eth0 -vvvv
 
 
 
				IP ROUTE
IP command to set a default router to 192.168.1.254
    ip route add default via 192.168.1.254
 

Showing the routes:	
	route -n
Or,
	ip route show

Deleting one rule from route
	ip route flush 10.10.2.0/24

Deleting all the routes
	ip route flush all

	

Using src in a routing command with route add
	ip route add default via 205.254.211.254 src 205.254.211.198 table 7
	

RTNETLINK answers: File exists
 means you are trying to add a routing rule or routing device that already exists




ifstat is an excellent tool to see all the interfaces of a host in real time.

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.


Add a new remote for your branch :
$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] 

Push changes from your commit into your branch :
$ git push origin [name_of_your_remote]

Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :
$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :
$ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop



To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :
$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]

Delete the branch on github :
$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]


Updating local repository from remote(It will update the branches that is created after you pulled last time):
$ git fetch

Force checkout a branch
$ git checkout -f working



--------------------------

Checking status of a git workspace
$ git status 






----------------Creating a new local brunch and pushing that branch to git---------------------
Create local branch and immediately switching to it (Remember its just a local branch):
$ git checkout -b Mybranch
Push the branch on github (This will push the branch working to the remote(github.com) repository) :
$ git push origin MyBranch
-------------------------------------
You can see all branches created by using :
$ git branch

Which will show (starred one is the  branch you are working on now):
* MyBranch
  master
  master_clean
----------------------

Deleting git branch. To delete a local branch (local filesystem): 
$ git branch -d the_local_branch
To delete a Remote branch: 
$ git push origin :the_remote_branch

----------------------------
Switching branch in local machine:
$ git checkout master   #will switch to branchmaster
$ git checkout working
-------------------------------------------
Say you worked on branch working and want to merge the changes to master branch. THen
$ git checkout master
$ git merge working
This will merge the additions or changes in working branch to the master

Once you have worked on a branch and want to delete it after you meged:
$ git branch -d the_local_branch

Virtual Box:
Listing all the vms:
	$ VBoxManage list vms
Listing running Vms:
	$ VBoxManage list runningvms

Starting a vm
	$ VBoxManage startvm vm_name

Entering vm:




Vim: 
yy to copy the line 
or 
dd to delete the line

then

p to paste the copied or deleted text after the current line 




To change your bad habit of using nano as 
modfy ~/.bashrc and include the following
alias nano=vim
source ~/.bashrc and you are all set


To check the arps known to a machine:



CONVERTING A text file to printable ps format code page.
	$ a2ps --line-numbers=1 -o packet.cc ~/Desktop/pgcgit/primogeni/netsim/src/ssfnet/os/packet.cc

you might have to apt-get a2ps before that. (-o is output file, --line numbers specify how often you want the line numebrs in the handout.)
	
	
One VIm shoftcut for navigation:
	zz makes line under the cursor center window.
	g; takes you to the most recent change backward.
	g, takes you to the future changes once you went few steps in the past changes list
	za to minimize a function or body surrounded by braces (code block)
	
	
Finding out what shell you are using 	
	ps -p $$

U can launch a different shell by entering that shell, e.g.
	/bin/bash
	
you can change the ownership of a folder or file by:
	sudo chown username /directiry


How to I find and replace every occurrence of a string and replace it in every text file under the /home/www/ directory tree (recursive find/replace).:
	subdomainA.example.com
		with 
	subdomainB.example.com

A:	cd to the directory
	$ find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/subdomainA.example.com/subdomainB.example.com/g'

	$ find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/..\/..\/dist/.\/lib/g'               //for replacing ../../dist with ./lib




Routing Table always matches longest prefix. 
10.1.0.0/24
10.1.0.0/16 
In this case first one will be taken


Sleep in a shell script or shell
	Where SUFFIX may be:
		s for seconds (the default), m for minutes,	h for hours, d for days.
	To sleep for 5 seconds, use:
		sleep 5
